            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS UPON A Scandalous Libel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHatever Reputation, my dear friend, the authority of your Judgment may give to what I have written for the service of the Publick; I cannot but think it hazardous to comply with your perswasion, on a subject which has less employ'd my thoughts; and wherein, by touching upon Parliamentary Debates, though to justify what has past in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Law, I may be thought to come near his Crime, who went about to support the tottering Ark.</p>
            <q>Sed me vincit Amor Regis, Patriae{que} tui{que}</q>
            <p>The severest Reflections in that Pamphlet which you communicated to me, like most of that kind, I take to be principally levell'd against his Majesty; who has given more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94244:3"/> proofs of the Sincerity of his Intentions for the good of Christendom, and of <hi>England</hi> in particular, than any of his Subjects can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably pretend to; and had done more but for some, who, doubt not, will have their reward in due time.</p>
            <p>It were easy to enumerate many of the Benefits which we owe to him, as the chief Instrument under the Almighty, who seems to intend much greater things by him.</p>
            <p>But, were there no other cause, you, and I, and all that value the <hi>English</hi> Liberties, ought to be thankful, for that fundamental point, which we may well hope is now, thro his Majesty, secured to all future ages.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">That this free People are not like <hi>French</hi> Galley Slaves, bound fast in an unalterable allegiance, to any Prince who governs ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically; nor are oblig'd, upon the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating his Authority, to prefer Birth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Merit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Light which has broken out upon this occasion, I take to have spread so far, that it will be impossible to stifle it: But if they who have acknowledged his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stys Right, by signing the National Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, much more, if any who contributed towards fixing that right, have been for <hi>distressing</hi> him, as the word is, that is weakning his hands, against his, and the Nations Enemies; who would, if possible, put out that light, or destroy them that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94244:3"/> follow it; can they be thought very sincere, or to maintain the Character of Patriots, which they assume all on a sudden? But, surely, they think the People of <hi>England</hi> have very short Memories, that they dare already venture upon an Appeal to 'em.</p>
            <p>Tho one Man pretends to have observ'd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 18. To give you a List as far as my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory will serve.</note> and remembred, what must have been owing to a Club; they, doubtless, judge of others by the real treachery of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; of whom the greater Number must be thought to forget the most remarkable Actions of their lives, and others their own Sufferings from their new Friends.</p>
            <p>Now like <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd for common Mischief, against the chief visible support of the true Profession of Christianity. But the Impotence of their Malice against this Government, and those who are most active for it, was never more evident than in their weak attempt to raise the People, upon Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> Mr. <hi>Palms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 2d. The Country feeling these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are provoked to great anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Parliament and can hardly restrain their hands from offering Violence to the Persons and Houses of the Members. Now, Sir, I must plainly confess to you on this head, that I think in the general that the County are in the right, and have plac'd their wroth on a true object. <hi>(b) p.</hi> 5.</note> Sir <hi>Walter Young,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Elwel,</hi> in the first place, and many more after them; against whose <hi>Persons and Houses</hi> they would animate a People, whose good nature they themselves had sufficiently tried and experienced: For were they forward to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94244:4"/> offer violence to <hi>persons and houses,</hi> it had been impossible but they had long since cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Insolence of some Mens pretences to be the <hi>Country Party;</hi> as if none but Wolves or Jaccals, were fit to be Shepherds. But next to their known Services to the Publick, whom these Men would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by Popular Fury,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 5.</note> nothing so much distinguishes 'em from others, as the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Mark</hi> the Enemies to this Government would set upon 'em.</p>
            <p>All who have heard of the present <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Exchequer,</hi> if they will be inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous must confess; that he has improved the advantage of being of a very noble and flourishing Family, by extraordinary, both natural and acquir'd, Abilities, exerted in the Service of this Government nor will he ever be forgiven his exposing the false Arguments of the <hi>Apostate Advocate</hi> for Popery; and I may say, <hi>the Apostate,</hi> with the <hi>new Country Party;</hi> and the setting off the Justice and Success of his Majesty's Arms, with that vein of wit and good sense, which is peculiar to him.</p>
            <p>Neither must Mr. <hi>Palms</hi> expect that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, upon which some, whose fears have been too strong for their Virtue, may be thought to rely; since he had so eminent a share in promoting the <hi>Bill of Exclusion;</hi> that early advance towards our <hi>present happy Settlement,</hi> to which he adheres with his known firmness to the good of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94244:4"/>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Young</hi> has given so many Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his being a right <hi>English</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who understands and values the Interest of his Country, and prosecutes it with true Sense, Courage, and Fidelity; that the opposite Party may well look upon him as a dangerous man.</p>
            <p>As they must Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> if it were for no other reason, but his truly representing the Town of <hi>Taunton Deane:</hi> which has, upon all occasions, given the most signal Testimonies of a steady affection to the Liberties of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> and such obstinate bravery, as might induce a belief, that the <hi>Ancient Britains</hi> had made that their principal retreat.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> being of himself, all that such a Consideration could inspire; and having manifested, how useful the Study of our Law may render worthy Gentlemen, of Estate above the <hi>Mercenary part of it;</hi> I am not surprized to find him here with a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Mark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor yet Sir <hi>John Elwell;</hi> who, by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Trade, with all its Consequences, took off from the Credit of their affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who thought to have impos'd upon Country Gentlemen; who, without such as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, knew not how to disprove 'em.</p>
            <p>But what are the mighty blots which ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish all their past Actions?</p>

               <hi>and the recoyning the Silver▪</hi> As if this were a Selling their Country, the reputation of which they have been long
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94244:5"/> possessed, and their own Estates, for places, during pleasure.</p>
            <p>The mischief of this project, as it is call'd, is laid in the supposition, that it was at a time <hi>when vast quantities, and in truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 2.</note>
               <hi>all our good Money had already been transported.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas the calling in the clipt and base Money yielded a Demonstration, that a great quantity of old mill'd, and broad Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, remained: and gave a Currency to what had been hoarded up till then; and would have continued so much longer, unless drawn out by the vast rates given by Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Coyners, and their Correspondents; who by degrees would have reached and diminished far the greatest part of it.</p>
            <p>But the pretence that <hi>all our good Money</hi> had been transported, is one of the usual figures in this Pamphlet; for, besides the good Silver, all must agree that we had vast quantities of Guineas, and so many more came in daily, as by degrees would have drawn out all our Silver, if their Price had not been lowered. The extravagance of which was not more owing to the badness of the Silver Coin, than to their contrivance, who, just upon the rising of the last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, obtained the Vote of a Committee to raise the Standard.</p>
            <p>However, 'tis evident, that 30 <hi>s.</hi> of the then current Silver were but uppn a par, or equivalent to the value of a Guinea; nor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94244:6"/> would the Guinea draw out 30 <hi>s.</hi> or 28 <hi>s.</hi> of old broad or mill'd Money, without such an unreasonable and absurd Law as this Paper contends for. Therefore the reducing the Guinea to the proportion which it bears to the intrinsick value of Silver, which is the Estimate put upon it by the Consent or Law of Nations (whatever might happen while the Silver was re-coining) was but the just and natural consequence of the Silvers being actually re-coin'd according to the Standard: which is the truest and most usual medium of Trade and Commerce, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts between Landlords and Tenents, and the like.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, whatever flourish is made about the price of Guineas; by which they who had hoards of other Mens Money, expected to leap into vast Estates at one stride; the chief Question is, whether the re-coining the Silver was well, and well timed: not but that the Arguments against suffering any pieces of Silver to go at more than the true value of the Silver,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation Where there be many counterfeit Testons, which were made by Counterfeitors when the Testons were at the value of 12 <hi>d.</hi> a piece, and since also they were decreed to 6 <hi>d.</hi> and by Estimation were so made, as they did contain about 2 <hi>d.</hi> farthing, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts in Silver; they shall do their endeavour to receive and try such Counterfeits, and shall give to the Subjects either for any such Counterfeit 2 <hi>d.</hi> farthing, or so much good fine Moneys as the same shall contain in Silver.</note> have much the same relation to Gold.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied but an attempt to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94244:6"/> reduce Silver to the Standard was more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous in the beginning of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign; when the Nation being but newly recovering out of Popery, was very apt to be stirr'd up at the least appearance of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and most of the Money then cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as till cried down it had but a sixth part of the intrinsick value; at the new Coynage had but about a third: so that by the new Coyning, two Thirds were dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, nor was any recompence made for this loss. Besides, the People were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted in their Representatives, whether they would consent to this change, but it was made by the <hi>Queens Proclamation:</hi>
               <note place="margin">20. <hi>E.</hi> 1.</note> Yet not without the Countenance of an old Statute, which provides, that no Merchant shall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or traffick with any Clipt or Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Money; and that others which had Clipt or Counterfeit Money should pierce it and carry it to the King's Exchange to be new coyned.</p>
            <p>Whatever hazard there were in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Statute, or the supposed Prerogative,<note place="margin">Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. Proclam. 2 of her Reign 29 <hi>Sep.</hi> 1560.</note> in this point; the Wisdom of that Queen's Council judged it expedient, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Interest of <hi>England</hi> made it successful; upon these grounds of no less force now.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such a Change would retreive the Ancient Honor and Reputation of the Wealth of this Realm; which used to have no Current-Monies but Gold and Silver:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94244:7"/> while other Nations had base Money, to their <hi>decay, infamy,</hi> and <hi>reproach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By continuing base Monies here, diverse persons both in foreign parts, and within the Realm, had counterfeited no small quantity, and uttered the same at first for 12 <hi>d.</hi> after that for 6 <hi>d.</hi> which was not worth above 2 <hi>d.</hi> and for those base Monies carried out of the Realm, its Commodities, as Wool, Cloath, Lead, Tinn, Leather, Tallow; and all kind of Victual, as Corn, Malt, Beer, Butter, Cheese, and such like: so that <hi>for a small Summ, Men have carried out six times the value in Commodities of the Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This being current had been exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Gold and fine Silver, which was transpotted: and of the great quantities that had been coyned in the two former Reigns, and in that, no part was seen commonly current.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Tho there had been plentiful years; yet the Prices of all things had been immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably increas'd: and no Remedy could be devis'd to amend the same; but to cause that the base Monies should be current for no more than they were in just value; for every Man of the least understanding knew, that a Teston was not worth Sixpence; and therefore no Man would give gladly that which was, and ever had been, worth Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, for a Teston.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94244:7"/>5. By bringing base Monies to their true value, and that all shall have fine Money for them, all poor People that lived of their Hand-labour, or by Wages, and all that lived upon Pentions and Stipends, and all Soldiers and Seamen, would be paid in fine Monies; with which they might buy more for their Sustentation than could afore be bought.</p>
            <p n="6">6. By this Reformation of base Monies, will necessarily follow, a more profitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count betwixt the Monies of this Realm, and of other Countries; and, thereby, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which by Merchants is called the <hi>Exchange,</hi> shall also arise in estimation of the Monies of <hi>England;</hi> as in former times has been, and the foreign Commodities thereby also bought for easier Prices.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">So as, the matter well considered, the greatest number, and especially the poorest, shall have most Commodity hereby; and such others as have gained most by excessive Prices, shall have (if they will consider) no small profit and help. And, finally, no manner of person in the whole Realm shall have, after one or two months, hurt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; except only the Traitor who has lived by Counterfeiting. And therefore it is to be allowed and embraced of all People, and every Man ought to think, that altho at the first he may suppose, that he hath less Mone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in his Purse; Yet shall he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94244:8"/> have for the same Metal as much as that was worth, either in Ware, or at the Mint in fine Monies: And whensoever he shall utter that base Money which he had at the time of Proclamation, the next that he shall get, either by his Hand-labor, or for his Wages, shall be either fine Monies, or such as he may have as much fine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the Mint for it. And, consequently, every Man ought to thank Almighty God, that he may live to see the Honor of his Country thus partly recovered, Silver to come in place of Copper, Prices of things amend, all People to be more able to live of their Wages, every Mans Purse or Coffer made free from the Privy Thief, which was the Counterfeitour: And, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Treasure of this Realm to be of Silver and Gold, as was wont in our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers time, and not of Brass and Copper: besides many other great Commodities that hereof must needs ensue; and no loss to any, but in opinion, at the beginning; not much unlike to them, that being sick receive a Medicine, and in the taking feel some bitterness, but yet thereby recover health, and strength, and save their Lives.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As a concurrence of the like causes and circumstances in one Age will produce the like events in another; what was true Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in this point in Queen <hi>Eliz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>beth</hi>'s Reign
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94244:8"/> is so now; and as a good History of past Transactions, may sometimes look like Prophecy of what is to come; all who have observed, in how many particulars his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty has restored the Memory of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Queen; must conclude, that he would, as far as he could act or influence without obstruction, follow her Counsels; who well knew, that while she was settled in the affections of the People, there was no danger in making them happy before they understood it.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Oh!<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 2.</note> but the great pains and labor the Court was at to gain an Act of Parliament for sinking our Gold, and putting a new face on our Silver, was only to qualify them for travel, and a necessary preparation for the Journey they were designed for: for they only staid at home because our Gold was too light, and our Silver too low, either too light in weight, or base in Metal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it will appear, that our Court is so far from blame in this matter, that it has answered the best ground of the Institution of Kings, and Courts: which, by being placed above low ends, are the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to discern and prosecute the good of all; and of particulars in relation to the Superiour Interest of the whole: In which respect, when a Nation cannot be safe without loss and hardship to several; that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94244:9"/>
'tis better <hi>to do wrong than do nothing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 18.</note> which is reproachfully charged upon Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> as his Maxim; is no more than that <hi>Common Law Maxim; a Private Mischief is better than a Publick Inconvenience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whoever will consider impartially, may easily find the truth of these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There was no immediate need of carrying Gold or Silver beyond Sea, while there was credit to get Bills payable abroad.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whatever might be sav'd by carrying out Gold and Silver at the real value; would bear but a small proportion to what the Court might have gain'd, in paying all its Debts in Money rais'd considerably above the intrinsick value.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If our Court had principally aimed at having Money, or Bills, to travel with; it might have had it with less difficulty; while there were so many Guineas current, so much Silver in Tale, and the many Millions in Credit, upon the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> the Million Lottery, and other Banks and Bankers: Especially if the Subscriptions and Funds projected for the <hi>Notional Land Bank,</hi> as some have too justly called it, had been added to the <hi>Bank of</hi> England.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whatever is, or will be lost to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons, upon the defect or mismanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any of these Banks; is, in effect, so much more clipt Money to the Creditors:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94244:9"/> and as they are vast Numbers, in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with them who were intrusted with their Monies; the speedier the stop is, that is put to these hazards, the safer will it be for the generality of people.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The continuance of so many Millions of clipt Money, or what is of that nature; suppose it should pass in tale, must necessarily by degrees draw out all the Gold and good Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Manufacture too; not only from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate hands, but from the Nation. For instance, suppose a Goldsmith having 1000<hi>l.</hi> in Silver deposited with him, melts it down, and sends it beyond Sea in Bullion; having Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit beyond his Stock, with his Note he buys to the value of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in Cloath, and so on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as far as his Credit will go; and sends all this beyond Sea he, being extravagant, spends high in Wine, or other things for the most part brought from abroad; and having made an unwise choice of a Correspondent, loses all the Bullion and Cloath which he sent over. In this case he not only deprives the Nation of so much Money and Goods, but lays a farther debt upon it to foreigners; by reason of the consumption of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; besides the advantage which the foreigner had, by the value which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of a more free passage has given Bullion beyond Coyn. And the loss would be the same if all should be safe in the Correspondents hands; but ordered to be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94244:10"/> kept there, to avoid the reach of Creditors, or the justice of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Or suppose 1000<hi>l.</hi> broad Money were clipt half away, and the clipt Money going in tale, should buy to the value of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in any of our Manufactures; and with the Clippings sent into <hi>Holland,</hi> 500 Guineas should be bought at 20 <hi>s. per</hi> Guinea, which here should go at 30 <hi>s.</hi> in this case the Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per would gain 750 <hi>l.</hi> out of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and if this should be kept abroad, so much would be lost to the Nation; at least no man can doubt but this would be the direct conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if this were all done by a Foreigner.</p>
            <p n="6">6. While the Guinea went at 30 <hi>s.</hi> or 28 <hi>s.</hi> and clipt Money according to the tale; the Kingdom thereby yearly lost much more to foreign parts, than went thither in any one year upon the account of the War: and now, besides saving that loss, gains in the exchange with foreigners more than is sent 'em by reason of the War.</p>
            <p n="7">7. However, as appears by the Gazette; the Merchants find it turn to account to Coyn Gold at their own charge,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Gazz.</note> and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the course of the exchange, cannot send any abroad without great loss; and it is affirmed by Merchants, that vast quantities are yet coming over. This, therefore will be an abundant supply for the diminution by Coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; and is likely in a short time, not only to equal what is hoarded out of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94244:10"/> but to draw that out, when foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by making a greater plenty of Money to circulate, drive men to a necessity of taking lower interest, or other profit for Money.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Formerly near as much was lost yearly to <hi>France,</hi> by the ballance of Trade, as has gone out in any year for carrying on the War: and much more than has this year</p>
            <p n="9">9. Whatever seeming or real scarcity there may now be of Money; it is to be ascrib'd to other Causes than what this Pamphlet touches upon: of which the most obvious are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great summs of Money that are sent over by the <hi>French</hi> Faction, to maintain King <hi>James,</hi> and carry on his Cause; nor can it be doubted but large summs have gone to procure late intended Invasions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The most enormous practices, and covetousness of money'd men, that ever were known in any age; it being usual for 'em to boast, that they can make 20 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> and a certain little Scrivener says 47 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> without which exorbitant gain they will not let Money circulate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The pernicious insinuation of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that the Guineas and Silver will at the next Sessions be raised: The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of which is industriously promoted, to keep Money from circulating; tho the great quantities of Gold which come daily
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94244:11"/> from aboard manifestly shew, that there was need of the provision which has been made, to keep the Silver at home.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The failure of the undertaking for a <hi>New Bank,</hi> for which, as some gave out▪ the first Subscription was ready upon the Parliamentary allowance; and yet was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in expectation of a very large discount: besides that <hi>the Bank of England</hi> was thereby depriv'd of some hundreds of thousand pounds, which were to have been paid by the <hi>new Bank</hi> in lieu of a Fund, which is lost to the <hi>Bank of England,</hi> without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent recompence.</p>

            <p n="1">1. That the Trade and necessities of this Nation are, or ever were, carried on, and supplyed, only by Cash; which, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of unaccountable circulations, and pledges, or credit, where Cash has not been at hand, has kept a very small proportion to the Trade, and necessities; to which we may add the conveniences of Life,<note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. If this Pamphlet has any regard to truth; it must suppose; that the Silver brough<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#murp" extent="1+ letters">

When if there be 6 Millions in Guineas, there are with old broad, and foreign Gold, together with the new Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and old mill'd and broad Money, above twelve Millions; of which not 500000<hi>l.</hi> has gone out this year, upon the account of the War: And, considering not only what we have saved in the whole exchange with Foreigners, but the considerable weight cast to the Ballance on our side; the Coinage has encreased the Cash of the Nation: and however, had there been any present loss by it; 'twould be like buying a little Rent Charge, for a small part of the yearly value.</p>

            <p n="2">2. How obvious soever this Pamphlet will have its Conjectures; the new coining the Silver, and lowering the Guineas, has been so far from having the consequences there foretold or imagined, that</p>
            <p n="1">1.

And if the Clipping Trade, and high price of Gold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, no Money would be left to pay him.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>His Majesty</hi> having,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 6.</note> with a true Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care of his People, recommended to the Parliament the redressing the ill state of the Coin; 10 <hi>Dec.</hi> 1695. Colonel <hi>Granvil</hi> report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Resolutions of a Committee relating to the re-coining Clipp'd Money, and putting a stop to the currency of it; which were agreed to by the House of Commons. 14 <hi>Dec.</hi> an Address to His Majesty, pursuant to those Resolutions was agreed upon: and 17 <hi>Dec.</hi> the Address, with His Majesty's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that he would issue his Proclamation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94244:17"/> accordingly, was reported by Mr. <hi>Mountagu;</hi> to whom the Resolutions are here said to have been chiefly owing. At the same time Mr. <hi>Mountagu</hi> presents a Bill for regulating the Coinage of the Silver Money. But, says the Pamphlet, when the Proclamation was issued, the days appointed by it were so sudden (and the same done, as is there said, by the Advice of Mr. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> contrary to that of the Major part of the Council) <hi>that an immediate stop and great difficulties ensued in Trade and Commerce; which being represented,</hi> and every Gentleman sensible of it, 31 <hi>Dec.</hi> they resolv'd, the next day to consider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the State of the Coin; and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the stop of Commerce during the re-coining the Clipp'd Money: which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned Resolutions very different from the former: which last were reported 9 <hi>Jan.</hi> and agreed to by the House.</p>
            <p>Upon which 'tis observable,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Pamphlet renders Mr. <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu</hi> more considerable than it can be thought to have intended; while it represents him as influencing the House of Commons, and prevailing against the Major part of His Majesty's Council.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The matter of which he is accus'd adds to his Honor; it being evident, that the more speedily the Clipp'd Money was call'd in, the sooner good Money would be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, without danger of diminution.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:94244:17"/>
            <p>If the Inconveniences which some Men laboured under by this, occasion'd such cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that the House of Commons found cause to recede, or vary from their former Resolutions, it may be said, according to our Saviours observation on the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law about Divorces; The clamorous in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were gratify'd, <hi>because of the hardness of their hearts:</hi> upon which account, God himself had given the <hi>Jews Statutes which were not good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whatever stop to Trade, was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by calling in the clipt Money, it is to be considered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the most of the clipt Money which came in, was upon the account of Taxes due to the Crown; which could not have been immediately current in Trade: so that the chief stop must have been for want of Currency, in what remain'd after the Taxes were paid.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Provision had been made, that all should pass immediately by weight, it had certainly given a Currency to all the Money, both clipt and unclipt, which were not brought into the Exchequer, or Mints: and besides, there would have been no need for so much lying dead, while it were to be coin'ds since the Clipping would have been effectually stopt at the very first.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, they who would have had all clipt Money pass immediately by weight,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94244:18"/> deserv'd, at least, as well of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as they who value themselves upon the following Resolutions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the recompence for supplying the deficiency of clipt Money, shall extend to all clipt money, which is Silver, altho of a courser Allay than the Standard.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Collectors and Receivers, of his Majesties Aids and Revenue, be enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive all such Monies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That a Reward of 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> be given to all such persons, as shall bring in either Mill'd, or broad unclipt Money, to be applyed in Exchange for clipt Money, throughout the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Commissioners be appointed, in every County, to pay and distribute the mill'd and broad unclipt Money, and the new coin'd Money, and to receive in the clipt Money.</p>
            <p>All these, but the last, and part of the third, were provided for by the Law which past; but that last Resolution, according to the Pamphlet, was too advantageous to the People to be ripen'd into an Act; and was opposed by Mr. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Young,</hi> Sir <hi>J. Elwell;</hi> and others of the Court party; who, in truth, were more for the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> than to account Clippers and Coyners, and their Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondents, <hi>the People.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:94244:18"/>1. While they could make 50 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> and more of clipt and base Money, none can imagine that broad Money could be brought for 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> to exchange clipt Money.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This therefore must have come from the Exchequer, which could not have it, till Money were new coin'd: nor then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because what was to come from the Customs and Excise, had been appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to other uses; so that the project was impracticable. Besides, as the Resolutions stand in the Pamphlet, this would have been to give the Clippers and Coiners an opportunity of keeping on their Trade, as long as the Coining in the Royal Mints lasted; As this Paper would have no bad Money lye useless and unprofitable, but as fast as 'twas clipt or coin'd, it should be exchanged for good; and as fast as the Mints supplied new Money, the bad from beyond Sea, or prepared at home, should swallow it up.</p>
            <p>21 <hi>Jan.</hi> a Bill upon the foregoing Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was read the second time, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a Committee of the whole House: But then the Court Party are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of a new Artifice, in bringing into play the price of Guinea's, altho that point could not then be gain'd.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:94244:19"/>
            <p>But when Resolutions had past, which we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e likely to give too long a currency to base and clipt Money, and so much Silver would for some time lye dead till it could come from the Mints; it certainly was high time, to consider the price of Guineas, which, without some stint, would soon have risen to above 30 <hi>s.</hi> and probably to 40 <hi>s. per</hi> Guinea: of which Foreigners would have profited themselves, as well as our Clippers and Coiners, and their Correspondents, who had engross'd the greatest part of 'em: Nor is it improper here to observe, that one Refiner, in a short time coin'd many above 100000.</p>
            <p>That this Committee did not sit for some days, which might proceed from the long sitting of the House, or other Accidents, is imputed as another Artifice: but 4 <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> the <hi>honest Patriots,</hi> whose love to their Country had made many Martyrs for it in former Reigns, gain'd an Instruction, that the Committee consider of a farther encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to be given, for bringing in Plate to be coin'd, and broad Money; in order to be exchanged for clipt Money. Where the useful point of encouraging the bringing in Plate, was clogg'd with provision for that darling of those <hi>honest Patriots,</hi> the clipt Money: for which they had so great a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, that, as the Pamphlet owns, they had not consented to prohibit the use of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94244:19"/> Plate in publick houses, but upon conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of exchanging the clipt Money: So that <hi>hitherto the Case of</hi> the Clippers and Coiners, whom they make <hi>the People was considered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 15. The House agreed to a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reported by Mr. <hi>Palms,</hi> that no Guinea do pass in any payment, at above the rate of 28 <hi>s.</hi> It is acknowledged that there were warm endeavours to have 'em reduced to 24 <hi>s.</hi> in which Mr. <hi>Palms</hi> is taxed with <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,</hi> and to have been deservedly checkt for it, by the old Members. But certainly, this Pamphlet does not <hi>impartially</hi> represent the matter; for it cannot be thought, that all the Old Members, thought their sense not fairly collected by the <hi>Chairman:</hi> for some of 'em at least were for lowering the Price. And therefore, here is no more than the opinion of some, who condemn Mr. <hi>Palms,</hi> for endeavouring to set the Question in such a light, that the Interest of the Publick might be the better understood. But it must not be forgotten, that the <hi>Patriots,</hi> as they would be thought; were for a Law to force the passing of Guineas at 28 <hi>s.</hi> which being after the resolution to bring all the Silver to the Standard, and to make a Recompence for the Deficiency, was an effectual way to carry out all the Silver: especially according to the Method, which hitherto stood, for changing base and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94244:20"/> clipt Silver, for broad, and mill'd Money: for as long as that changing lasted, a Guinea purchased with 28 <hi>s.</hi> of base Allay, or clipt Money, should draw out 28 <hi>s.</hi> of Standard Money, or Manfuactures to that value: Tho the Method they proposed did not succeed, the consequence would be much the same till the 4th of <hi>May,</hi> or rather to the 4th of <hi>June,</hi> and as long after as any Officers in the Exchequer would receive clipt Money upon Goldsmiths Notes, which they had accepted before as actual payment.</p>
            <p>Suppose if Money, which had a currency according to the tale, as long as it could be brought so into the Exchequer, 100 <hi>l.</hi> by reason of the baseness of the Metal, had not been worth above 50 <hi>l.</hi> and this 50 <hi>l.</hi> in value, as was usual, weighed not above one third of the Standard weight; in this case, the home or foreign Clipper or Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and their Correspondents, had gained 83 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> in every hundred: and this being invested in Guineas, should, in effect, continue the profit of Clipping and Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after the false Money were call'd in.</p>
            <p>And suppose the Guineas were honestly Bought beyond Sea by a foreigner, after all our Silver was reduced to the Standard; and without the product of false Money: the Foreigner would have gain'd, of our Silver and Manufactures 40 <hi>l.</hi> in every hundred, as his Guinea cost him but 20 <hi>s.</hi> but would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94244:20"/> cost any man here, that were to procure it, 28 <hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there not appearing any limitation of time, for the intended passing of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas at 28 <hi>s.</hi> the Exportation of our Silver and Manufactures, at so great a disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, would have lasted as long as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had any thing to lose. No wonder therefore that the fall of Guineas to 28 <hi>s.</hi> did not satisfie those who laboured for the good of <hi>England:</hi> however all they could gain, towards the service of the publick in that point, by 28 <hi>Feb.</hi> was, after a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, to prevail, that Guineas should not pass for more than 26 <hi>s.</hi> but alas! the <hi>good Patriots</hi> were unwarily drawn in, to admit, that the Nation should lose no more than 30 <hi>l.</hi> in every hundred: which, it seems, they had never consented to, without the expectation, that the loss should be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, without farther attempt to improve any favourable opportunity of easing the Nation of this burden.</p>
            <p>But <hi>did the Court acquiesce</hi> in suffering the Nation to lye under this? <hi>No such matter;</hi> but instead of that, pursued with all vigour the sinking Guineas much lower; and at length gain'd it; and not only so, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to throw out all that related to the exchanging of broad, or mill'd, for clipt Money. Surely they were ill-natur'd, to spoyl the hopeful Project, of the <hi>New Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:94244:21"/> who had taken such care of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Clippers,</hi> and <hi>Coiners;</hi> that they had well nigh procur'd 'em, the <hi>Philosophers Stone:</hi> but, by ill luck, it went away in smoke, when it was just coming to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Could they but have kept Guineas at 26 <hi>s.</hi> and have had all the base and clipt Money exchanged for broad and mill'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the work had succeeded to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
            <p>For suppose 16 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> which might have been the value of 100 <hi>l.</hi> in tale, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been exchanged for 100 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, had been projected upon foreign Gold, this would have yielded 130 <hi>l.</hi> which had been one upon more than seven: if they had proceeded, and with this 130 <hi>l.</hi> had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased more such base Money; that upon the change for good, would have yielded 713 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> which being again project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Gold, would have produc'd more above 214 <hi>l.</hi> together 927 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> which is above 54 upon one. Repeat the process, the encrease would be <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> and others, well knowing that these mens Mercury would have carry'd away all the Silver, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted it into foreign Gold; broke the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Glasses, which cover'd the work: Nor are the home and foreign <hi>Clippers and Coiners</hi> likely ever to advance so far again.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94244:21"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus they were left to shift with their clipt Money, as well as they could: Here you see the root of the decay of</hi> their <hi>Trade; the desolation among the poor</hi> Operators; <hi>that stock of dead and unprofitable Money, which lyos upon their hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In taking care to stop this from passing, they, who are invidiously called the <hi>Court Party,</hi> truly shewed themselves, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Representatives of the <hi>People of England;</hi> who cannot think any present Deficiency of Money, to be a grievance, bearing the least proportion, to what they should have labour'd under, if the Clippers and Coiners, had had their <hi>Philosophers Stone.</hi> In the Twelve hundred thousand pound, which was given to supply the deficiency; they cannot but think, that the Parliament considered many here, as God did the <hi>Jews;</hi> when he adapted Laws to their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: and as those gave an Indulgence to what was condemn'd by the more perfect Law; It is certain, that the most Criminal Managers of Money, have, and will get most by this.</p>
            <p>The Pamphlet would argue, that they who would not have the Peoples clipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney exchanged for good, are the very same, who put a Stop to the Currency of their other Money: upon supposition, that their influence occasion'd the first stop to their other Money, by the Refusal of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94244:22"/> Sixpences, not clipt within the Ring: which according to this Paper, began with the Collectors of the Taxes. This goes upon the supposition, that Sixpences, were all the current Money left: and indeed, the <hi>Clippers</hi> and <hi>Coiners</hi> with their Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, endeavoured to make 'em so. Nor, was it very surprizing, to see how suddenly Goldsmiths in Town were furnished with Sixpences, to answer all demands: but it is well known, that the first stop to these Payments, was put by Mr. <hi>Paschal:</hi> whom I must name with honour; his arresting a Goldsmith who pretended to have no other good Money, having dasht that project of continuing the clipping Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But whatever becomes of our Silver, we have yet our Guineas passable at</hi> 26 <hi>s.</hi> and tho a Clause for bringing them down to 22 <hi>s.</hi> was rejected, <hi>March</hi> 20; at the third reading the Bill, <hi>March</hi> 26. it past, after many hours Debate; as the Paper says, by a small Number: and yet, according to that List, there were for this 205, of the Patriots 174; and to give them Reputation, some Men of true worth added; who either were against them, particularly the Lord <hi>Ashley,</hi> and Lord <hi>Henry Cavendish,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or out of Town, as Mr. <hi>Wm. Ash:</hi> then, if from their List, we take the <hi>Non-Associators,</hi> who to a Man were for chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing base and clipt Money for good, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94244:22"/> keeping up the Price of Guineas, but will never pass with the People for <hi>Patriots;</hi> the number of mislead <hi>Patriots</hi> will appear very few: nor is it to be doubted but by this time, they all see their Error.</p>
            <p>I must not omit the <hi>Pamphlets</hi> parting blow; that they who carried the lowering the Price of Guineas, and re-coining the Silver according to the Standard, without providing for exchanging bad Money for good; struggled hard to have had all clipt Money pass by weight immediately, and Guineas reduced to 21 <hi>s.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> and none of the Loss to have been born by the publick.</p>
            <p>The Wisdom and Integrity of which endeavour is already manifested; by the event, of the best remedy they could gain to the inconveniences the publick labour'd under. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. The permitting clipt Money to be received in the Revenue till the 4th of <hi>May,</hi> and in the Exchequer till the 4th of <hi>June;</hi> continued the Clipping and Coyning Trade till then.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It put Goldsmiths upon trading in clipt Money long after, by the covin of some of the Officers of the Exchequer; who suffer'd 'em to bring in clipt Money, as they could procure it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It so long kept good Money from circulating; when if clipt Money had from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94244:23"/> the beginning gone by weight; that, for so much as it weighed, would have been as good as the broadest.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whereas the chief pretence for a Recompence, was the relieving poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and other such people; who had clipt Money in their hands, and by lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tale, would be disabled from paying their Rents, or supplying their Occasions; this will appear to have been in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure engross'd, by those who either had made too much before of other mens Moneys; or who had lately bought up clipt Money, at 25 <hi>l.</hi> or 30 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> profit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Tho the affirmations of men, who knew better; might lead some well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Patriots,</hi> to believe that in <hi>Holland,</hi> a Guinea was worth 24 <hi>s.</hi> of our mill'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it appears, that it is now brought from thence; and elsewhere, to sufficient profit, at 22 <hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I followed this Libel, step by step; and tho with no share of that sense, with which Mr. <hi>Mountagu,</hi> Mr. <hi>Palms,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> and others defeated <hi>that part of the Plot;</hi> yet, I think, common sense, has enabled me to discern the design, and draw it out to publick view. Tho all men are not to be charged with the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of what they contend for; yet they are undoubtedly to be urged against the things themselves: and, if we should
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94244:23"/> judge of him or them, who emitted this Pamphlet, according to the immediate consequences of what it pursues; we are to conclude,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they either, have Pensions from some foreign Prince, at least equivalent to the loss they must, by their Method, have sustained in all future times; or that they are <hi>Clippers</hi> and <hi>Coyners,</hi> with their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondents; whose gains, if their project had succeeded, would have been without end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they are Enemies, not only to <hi>our King,</hi> and <hi>Court;</hi> but to the good of <hi>England.</hi> Indeed formerly, our Courts had been so much against <hi>England;</hi> that to be an <hi>Anticourtier</hi> was almost the <hi>Characteristick</hi> of a <hi>true Englishman:</hi> but when our Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives the Constitution, and gives an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of preferring the publick, before all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interests; to defame, and seek to set it aside, is no proper way to recommend men to their Country. This is not the first time, that I have had occasion of applying that of <hi>Claudian.</hi>
